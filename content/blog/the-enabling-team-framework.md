How enabling teams can move from reactive support to strategic capability uplift through clear roles, sequential elements, and delivery modes.

A comprehensive framework for how enabling teams should think about, organize, and deliver capability transformation work across an organization. Based on real-world experience diagnosing why capability adoption fails, this framework breaks down complex capability uplift into manageable components.

## Framework Structure

The framework organizes capability transformation through:

### Three Distinct Roles

1. **Advising** - Strategic guidance and consultation
2. **Developing** - Building tools, processes, and solutions
3. **Facilitating** - Enabling adoption and competency building

### Sequential Elements

The framework follows a logical sequence from Policy through Governance, ensuring each element builds on the previous:

- **Policy** - Why it matters and what's required
- **Process** - How work gets done
- **Tools** - What enables the work
- **Enablement** - Building competency
- **Governance** - Ensuring sustainability

### Three Delivery Modes

1. **Strategizing** - Planning and designing solutions
2. **Developing** - Building and implementing
3. **Facilitating** - Supporting adoption and change

## Key Insights

You need all pieces at some level of definition to get new solutions to stick:

- **Skip the policy** and teams won't understand why it matters
- **Skip operationalizing the process** and tools won't address real friction points
- **Skip enablement** and teams struggle to build competency

## Practical Tools

The framework includes:
- **Diagnostic gap analysis** to identify what's missing
- **Five epic templates** for organizing work
- **Practical guidance** on identifying which operational teams will implement the processes you're transforming

This structured approach helps enabling teams move from reactive support to strategic capability uplift, ensuring that capability transformation efforts actually stick and deliver lasting value.
