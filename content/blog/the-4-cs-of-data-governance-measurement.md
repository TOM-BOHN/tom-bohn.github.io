How to measure data governance transformation using Capability, Capacity, Competency, and Compliance.

A comprehensive framework for measuring data governance transformation beyond compliance metrics alone. The framework emerged from a recurring question every data leader asks: "How do we know if our data governance program is actually working?" Leaders invest in tools, hire people, and create policies—but struggle to demonstrate progress.

## The Framework

The 4 Cs framework—Capability, Capacity, Competency, and Compliance—provides a holistic approach to measuring data governance maturity and tracking cultural change across organizations. It addresses three critical measurement categories (maturity, efficiency, effectiveness) and reveals why measuring only compliance misses 75% of what makes governance successful.

Based on experience implementing data governance across multiple organizations, the framework includes specific metrics for each dimension, data collection methods, real-world scenarios, and practical guidance on demonstrating value to leadership.

## Key Insights

- **Cultural change indicators** reveal whether governance is becoming embedded or remains a checkbox exercise
- **Capability maturity** determines long-term sustainability
- Measuring only compliance misses 75% of what makes governance successful

The framework shows how cultural change indicators reveal whether governance is becoming embedded or remains a checkbox exercise, and how capability maturity determines long-term sustainability.
